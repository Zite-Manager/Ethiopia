The analysis is done predominately by sector to support all service providers working in displacement sites understanding of community feedback. It is important for the humanitarian response to be operationally accountable for our collective response to community feedback.\nThis analysis is automatically generated every quarter for each Camp Coordination and Camp Management program using Zite Manager to support their multi-sectoral Community Feedback Mechanism.\nThis section needs some additions and editing.

CCCM received a total of CCCM of the total tickets received – an increase/decrease of TBC% during this reporting period. The most feedback was collected from Shire Kebele 02 - ABA, Sebacare 4, and Kutiso Market.\nOf the total feedback received, 29 tickets were referred to the responsible service providers, and 4 tickets were closed upon receipt . The table below shows the top 5 tickets that were referred during this reporting period with Over the reporting period, Solar street Lights as the top feedback received for the sector. This issue saw a TBC% increase or decrease in tickets when compared to the last reporting period.\nFor the referred tickets, 2 tickets were still being processed at time the of report generation with 2, and 1 had received a response from the service provider but yet to be followed-up by CCCM at the time of reporting. \n\n\n['ticket',\n 'site_id',\n 'site',\n 'url',\n 'status_current',\n 'comments',\n 'date_last_reviewed',\n 'reason_current',\n 'date_received',\n 'channel_received',\n 'channel_group',\n 'channel_impact',\n 'ticket_type',\n 'status_initial',\n 'reason_initial',\n 'description',\n 'sector',\n 'flagged',\n 'gender',\n 'age',\n 'date_reply',\n 'reply_group',\n 'channel_reply',\n 'reply_resolution',\n 'feedback_about',\n 'disability',\n 'demographic',\n 'received_user',\n 'reply_user',\n 'priority',\n 'pwd',\n 'host',\n 'region_1',\n 'region_2',\n 'region_3',\n 'site_type',\n 'Case Information Details/Number of Submissions in Case',\n 'lon',\n 'lat',\n 'ADM1_PCODE',\n 'ADM1_EN',\n 'ADM2_PCODE',\n 'ADM2_EN',\n 'ADM3_PCODE',\n 'ADM3_EN',\n 'v_cur',\n 'v_flag',\n 'v_inpro',\n 'v_open',\n 'v_closed',\n 'v_refer',\n 'v_response',\n 'v_resolved_sp',\n 'v_resolved_ap',\n 'v_resolved_both',\n 'v_resolved_either',\n 'v_replied',\n 'v_exp',\n 'v_day_diff_reply',\n 'v_day_diff_reply_median',\n 'v_day_diff_reply_mean']\n\n\n\n\n\nshape: (4, 2)status_currentcountstru32\"Responded\"51\"Closed\"383\"Open\"19\"In-Progress\"1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Sectoral reply rate\n  \n\n\n  reason_current\n  referred\n  replied\n  % replied\n\n\n\n  Lack of Funding\n  3\n  3\n  100%\n\n\n  Can't Resolve\n  1\n  1\n  100%\n\n\n  Resolved\n  3\n  3\n  100%\n\n\n  Closed upon receipt\n  3\n  3\n  100%\n\n\n  Pending\n  2\n  2\n  100%\n\n\n  No Response\n  12\n  11\n  92%\n\n\n  \n  5\n  3\n  60%\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Source: IOM & partners\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nFigure 9: CCCM Sectoral reply rate\n\n\n\n\nWithin the reporting period, % of referred tickets were replied to by CCCM and then closed.

One issue could also represent a problem faced by more than one person or household, such as a broken water tap.\nReceived: Total pieces of feedback (also known as tickets) that were received in the reporting period.\nReferred: Tickets that were referred to sector partners for their assessment, action (if possible) and response. Not all tickets are referred depending on the type of feedback reported. If a ticket is Referred or not is based on the CFM sector standards circulated by CCCM cluster/sector.\nClosed Upon Receipt: Are tickets that are not referred because they are addressed immediately, or we know it cannot be resolved (e.g., no agency providing that service), the ticket is “closed upon receipt” and is not referred.\nResponded awaiting reply: Tickets that have received a response from an service providers but the response has not been provided to the person who reported the problem yet. CCCM partners have a commitment towards following-up with affected persons and closing the feedback loop.\nExpired or ‘No Response’: If no response is received by the responsible service provider within 30 days of referral, the ticket is marked as having “No Response” and is sent automatically for follow-up. This means that CCCM must explain to the person that a response could not be obtained from the service provider and the ticket is closed.\nResponses by Service Provider: To support analysis, service provider’s responses are coded according to a list of common reasons why a piece of feedback could not be addressed. Resolved means the service provider has resolved the issue.\nReported Resolution by the affected population: During the follow up, people have a chance to report whether the response has resolved their issue (Yes, No, Partially or Don’t know). This information is then visualized to record people’s perception of whether their feedback is resolved.\nThe analysis also compares the two resolution rates to communicate the percentage of cases where both service provider and affected person report the issue as resolved.\nWhen interpreting these figures, it is important to understand that a low percentage of confirmed resolution rates suggests a possible communication issue between CCCM and the service provider or between the CFM staff completing the reply process with the affected community, or a combination of both. For example, if there is no response from the service provider to CCCM, the ticket it is not considered resolved by service provider, but the person who reported the feedback might report the feedback as resolved for other reasons. However, we don’t expect to see a 100% confirmation rate for resolution because it is normal to see differences. For example, the service provider might consider their actions to a piece of feedback to be a resolution, but the person who reported the feedback might not agree and reported the feedback as partially resolved or unresolved."
